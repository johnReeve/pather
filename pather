/**
 *  Notes:
 *
 * I'm not too much for putting php into a bash script, but I didn't want to deviate from the instructions in any way.
 *
 * I think that there are a lot of good approaches to the problem, but stuck to a simple procedural style due
 * to the brevity of the problem.
 *
 * There is no point ordering listed in the spec, so I just used an ordering that generates the expected outcome.  It
 * would be possible to generate a different path set if you, say, reversed or randomize the order of the points.
 *
 * There is no validation for the map: the program assumes all lines are equal length.  As such, the program breaks if
 * the lines are unequal length.  We could either invalidate the map or write code that expands the map (given the nature
 * of arrays in PHP all we'd do is to make sure that the path drawing coe pushes newline characters to the end of a line's array).
 *
 * the xy coordinate convention is inverted in this code, as it is easier to keep xy straight in my head, even if the actual map is yx
 *
 * the program with overwrite an existing output file
 *
 * I don't do any error handling with the file write at all
 *
 *  Adding some way of easily expanding the test runner in path-problem.sh would be an easy thing to do and simplify adding test cases.
